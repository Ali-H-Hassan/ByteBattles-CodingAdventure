ByteBattle is built using the following technologies:

- The frontend is developed with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), providing a robust and responsive user interface.
- Backend services are powered by [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/), ensuring efficient server-side operations.
- For game development, the [Phaser Library](https://phaser.io/) is used, enabling interactive and dynamic game experiences within the platform.
- The application uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for database management, offering scalable and flexible data storage.
- Additional libraries and tools like [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) for file uploads and various React and Redux dependencies enhance the functionality and user experience.
